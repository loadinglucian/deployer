## Crash Course

Here's the crashiest of crash courses to start deploying immediately:

```shell
# 1. Install as a dev dependency
composer require --dev loadinglucian/deployer-php

# 2. Add an alias for convenience
alias deployer="./vendor/bin/deployer"

# 3. Add your server to the inventory
deployer server:add

# Replace server:add with your favorite provider
# to provision an instance and automatically add
# it as a server to your inventory:
# deployer aws:provision
# deployer do:provision

# 4. Install your preferred database service:
# deployer mariadb:install
# deployer mysql:install
# deployer postgresql:install
# deployer redis:install
# deployer valkey:install
# deployer memcached:install

# 5. Install Nginx, PHP, Bun and generate a deploy key
deployer server:install

# 6. Create a site
deployer site:create

# 7. Generate deployment hooks (run from your project directory)
deployer scaffold:hooks

# 8. Upload your .env file to the server
deployer site:shared:push

# 9. Deploy your application
deployer site:deploy

# 10. Enable HTTPS (after DNS propagates)
deployer site:https
```
