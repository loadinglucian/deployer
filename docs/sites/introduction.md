# Introduction

Sites are applications deployed to your servers. DeployerPHP manages the complete lifecycle from creation through deployment, including automation like cron jobs and background processes.

Sites are stored in your local inventory and linked to a server. Each site has its own Nginx configuration, PHP-FPM pool, and directory structure.

> Commands below run interactively. For automation, see [Command Replay](/docs/automation/command-replay).
