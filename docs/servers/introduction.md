# Introduction

DeployerPHP maintains a local inventory of your servers. Before you can deploy sites or install services, you need to add servers to this inventory and install the base packages.

All server commands follow the pattern `server:<action>` and can be run interactively or with command-line options for automation.

> [!NOTE]
> Commands below run interactively. For automation, see [Command Replay](/docs/automation/command-replay).
